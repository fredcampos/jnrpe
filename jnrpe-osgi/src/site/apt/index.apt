JNRPE OSGI package

   The JNRPE osgi package contains two bundles: 
   
   * <<jnrpe-osgi-core>> : the main JNRPE server bundle. This bundle is
   <<required>>.
   
   * <<jnrpe-plugins-core>> : contains the plugins distributed with JNRPE
   packaged as OSGI bundle. You just have to copy them to the right
   directory: JNRPE will automatically discover and load them at runtime.
